I got too into trying CodeWars Katas because I love to learn through practice, however I will now finish the Makers course and watch youtube videos on Python before attempting more CodeWars.

### Notes
Only thing of note so far (021) is that expressions in Python follow bidmas? maths rules and you should add parenthesis to control the output you want

### 023
```Python
def get_nth_letter(the_str, n):
  return(the_str[n])
```
originally I tried: return(the_str,[n])   because I thought it had to be in the same format but it makes sense that when its called from out of the function it needs the ","
but once its been called its already in the function and you can do whatever you want with it
