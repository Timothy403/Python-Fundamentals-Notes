I got too into trying CodeWars Katas because I love to learn through practice, however I will now finish the Makers course and watch youtube videos on Python before attempting more CodeWars.

### Notes
Only thing of note so far (021) is that expressions in Python follow bidmas? maths rules and you should add parenthesis to control the output you want

### 023
```Python
def get_nth_letter(the_str, n):
  return(the_str[n])
```
originally I tried: return(the_str,[n])   because I thought it had to be in the same format but it makes sense that when its called from out of the function it needs the ","
but once its been called its already in the function and you can do whatever you want with it 

### 029
```Python
your_list = list(range(1, 11))
print(your_list)
```
print(*range(1,11)) alone it prints out each number seperately, not in a list

## 031

I do not like how I can see the check code and it obscures showing how the function is being called. I want to be able to clearly see where you position your arguments at a glance, (['a', 'b'], 'b') = function called //////
(['a', 'b'], 'b'), ['a'])  = function called and checked,  the final [a] was confusing

### Data structures
index looks at the position
pop removes the indexed item or last appended item if not specified
remove removes the called items
count counts how many times the called item appears
reverse replaces the original list and returns none so ::-1 is better as it creates a copy (self taught)
def reverse_list(the_list):
  return the_list[::-1]
