### Important notes

* "x for x in list"

* the x is now a temporary variable, it doesn't matter if its an item from a list or a character from a string, you can manipulate that variable with functions.
* mainly, you can use len() on it for counting 

becareful with nested *ifs*, make sure to close ifs with an else and use *continue* if all posibilities are not caught in the if statements

when you need to go through a single int in a loop you can do:
```Python
for _ in range(n)
```
