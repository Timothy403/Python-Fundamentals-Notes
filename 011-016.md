### ### Intro notes

- def is used to create a function which can be recalled later

- what you write after def is what you are calling it

- we use spaces in the lines to show what is in the "body" of a function such as def or while

- whats in the brackets is the parameter, an input

- and input must be returned as an output or true/false 

- colon is used to signal the start and end of a function (def ends with return)

- when you type something in the brackets it becomes a variable just like when you type


```Python
number = 1
def example(num):    # number and num are now both variables we made 
  return num + 1
```
