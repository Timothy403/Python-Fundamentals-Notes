### ### Intro notes

- def is used to create a function which can be recalled later

- what you write after def is what you are calling it

- we use spaces in the lines to show what is in the "body" of a function such as def or while

- whats in the brackets is the parameter, an input

- and input must be returned as an output or true/false 

- colon is used to signal the start and end of a function (def ends with return)

- when you type something in the brackets it becomes a variable just like when you type


```Python
number = 1
def example(num):    # number and num are now both variables we made 
  return num + 1
```







### OPERATOR PLAYGROUND STARTS
```Python
builtin = pow(2, 3)
print(f"2 pow 3 = {builtin} (should be 8)")

original = (-10 % 7)
print(f"Without fmod its {original} (instead of a negative number)")

negative = math.fmod(-10, 7)          #previously imported the math module to show how there are "operator" varations through math helpers 
print(negative)

#terminal output
#2 pow 3 = 8 (should be 8)
#Without fmod its 2 (instead of a negative number)
#-3.0
```
