def is used to create a function which can be recalled later
what you write after def is what you are calling it
we use spaces in the lines to show what is in the "body" of a function such as def or while
whats in the brackets is the parameter, an input
and input must be returned as an output or true/false 
colon is used to signal the start and end of a function (def ends with return)
when you type something in the brackets it becomes a variable just like when you type
```Python
number = 1
def example(num):    # number and num are now both variables we made 
  return num + 1
```
