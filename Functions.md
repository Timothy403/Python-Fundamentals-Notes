### Clear and alphabetically ordered notes to quickly check

- abs() = Distance from 0, negative integer/variable into positive
- capitalize = Uppercase the first character
+ .copy = Makes a copy of a variable. Safeguards .remove and .append sideaffects.
- enumerate =  Loop over an iterable and return its (index, item) works with more than just lists.
+ heapq = Quicker alternative to sort, O(n) instead of O(n log n), -------- small1, small2 = heapq.nsmallest(k, iterable)  default = ascending order, Key possible e.g. = (2, iterable, key=len)      (Import)
- isinstance() = Check class/subclass type. Safeguard or differentiate inputs.
+
- .join() = joins strings using a seperator, using '' as a "seperator" just squishes them together. 
+ lambda = Small, one use, one line, Def.
- max and min = Highest/Lowest of an iterable, Key possible e.g. = print(max(words, key=len))
+ .replace =  original.replace(old, new[, count]). Can remove spaces in a string by using *variable.replace(" ", "")*
- upper/lower = Changes an entire string into upper or lowercase.
