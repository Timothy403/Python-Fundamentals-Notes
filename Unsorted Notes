### Repeated notes or notes that will be sorted in the future

I will probably go back to my other notes and try to make them more concise, this file can store my messy thought/learning process.

### Revise
 isinstance() - can check classes as well as subclasses, you use it to check if data was inputed in the type you wanted or to do two different things based on data type.
 ZeroDivisionError - division by zero   = if not numbers:
 enumerate (index loop) - Loop over an iterable and return the item as well as its index, avoids manual counters and works with more than just lists.
 .join() - joins strings using a seperator, using '' as a "seperator" just squishes them together. 
 capitalize vs upper - capitalize converts the first character of a string into uppercase, upper converts all. 
 max and min -
 abs() -
 type -
 str/int/list, how to change one into the other -
 .replace -
 heapq instead of sort -
 .copy to makeup for .remove -
 the idea of float('inf') -
 

(return "odd" if sum(arr) % 2 else "even") - This works because 0 is "falsy" and any other integer is naturally "truthy, so if truthy it must not be divisible by 2 therefore it is odd

If you want to strip all whitespace in a string (\t, \n, etc.), use split()+join() as return "".join(s.split())

 bitwise ops:  return number * 9 if (number & 1) else number * 8    -    is slightly faster for the cpu to process than    -   return number * 9 if number % 2 else number * 8

any comparison operator ( >, <, ==, != ) returns a boolean value so "True" and *if* are not needed in this example, return True if bullets >= dragons * 2 else False

thinking about time complexity, comparing different solutions based on their readability and time complexity

no need to write [0:2], you can just write [:2]
