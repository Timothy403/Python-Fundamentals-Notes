### Repeated notes or notes that will be sorted in the future

I will probably go back to my other notes and try to make them more concise, this file can store my messy thought/learning process.

### Revise
 isinstance() 
 ZeroDivisionError: division by zero   = if not numbers:
 enumerate (index loop)
 .join()
 capitalize vs upper
 max and min
 abs()   
 type
 str/int/list, how to change one into the other
 .replace  
 heapq instead of sort

(return "odd" if sum(arr) % 2 else "even") - This works because 0 is "falsy" and any other integer is naturally "truthy, so if truthy it must not be divisible by 2 therefore it is odd

If you want to strip all whitespace in a string (\t, \n, etc.), use split()+join() as return "".join(s.split())

 bitwise ops:  return number * 9 if (number & 1) else number * 8    -    is slightly faster for the cpu to process than    -   return number * 9 if number % 2 else number * 8

any comparison operator ( >, <, ==, != ) returns a boolean value so "True" and *if* are not needed in this example, return True if bullets >= dragons * 2 else False

thinking about time complexity, comparing different solutions based on their readability and time complexity

no need to write [0:2], you can just write [:2]
