### Repeated notes or notes that will be sorted in the future

I will probably go back to my other notes and try to make them more concise, this file can store my messy thought/learning process.

### Revise
* isinstance() 
* ZeroDivisionError: division by zero   = if not numbers:
* enumerate (index loop)
* .join()
* capitalize vs upper
* max and min
* abs()   
* type
* str/int/list, how to change one into the other
* .replace  

(return "odd" if sum(arr) % 2 else "even") - This works because 0 is "falsy" and any other integer is naturally "truthy, so if truthy it must not be divisible by 2 therefore it is odd

If you want to strip all whitespace in a string (\t, \n, etc.), use split()+join() as return "".join(s.split())
